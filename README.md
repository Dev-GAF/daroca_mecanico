## 📝 Description

The system was implemented to facilitate the organization and management of schedules, automating tasks that were previously done manually, such as filling out hours and managing availability.

## 👨‍💻 Technologies Used:

* Python: Used to create the logic of the program, which runs in the terminal. Python was responsible for capturing the data entered in the terminal and sending it to the SQL Server.
* Microsoft SQL Server: The data provided by the teacher was stored in the database. The program, running in the terminal, receives the data entered by the user and stores it in the tables already created in SQL Server.
